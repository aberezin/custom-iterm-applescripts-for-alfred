-- This is v0.5 of the custom script for AlfredApp for iTerm 2.9+
-- Please see https://github.com/stuartcryan/custom-iterm-applescripts-for-alfred/
-- for the latest changes.

on is_running(app_name)
	tell application "System Events" to (name of processes) contains app_name
end is_running

-- Please note, if you store the iTerm binary in any other location than the Applications Folder
-- please ensure you update the two locations below (in the format of : rather than / for folder dividers)
-- this gets around issues with AppleScript not handling things well if you have two iTerm binaries on your system... which can happen :D
